## Priority Tasks

### High Priority (Core Gameplay) 🔥
- [x] **Projectile Target Locking**: Projectiles should 'lock' on to original target and only change if target is destroyed
- [x] **Danger-Based Turret Targeting**: Turret now prioritizes asteroid targets by danger - asteroids on collision course with city get highest priority, then closest ones
- [x] **Projectile Lock Release**: Projectiles should release lock on any asteroids below the screen
- [x] **Projectile AI Diversification**: Each projectile now has unique targeting behavior (10 distinct AI personalities)
- [x] **Target Distribution System**: Projectiles coordinate to prevent clustering on same asteroid

### Medium Priority (User Experience) ⚡
- [ ] **Fix Play Again Functionality**: Auto-start next game and correctly reset all systems
- [ ] **Relocate Health Display**: Move health and shield status to be nearer the city

### Low Priority (UI Cleanup) 🧹
- [x] **Remove Duplicate Score Display**: Removed yellow score in top left and green city health in top right
- [x] **Remove Store Access**: Eliminated storefront accessible from pause menu, using only inset upgrade panel
